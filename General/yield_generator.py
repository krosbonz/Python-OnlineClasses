# Yield

"""The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value 
back to caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where 
it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately 
after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values 
over time, rather them computing them at once and sending them back like a list."""

# A "generator" is any function that contains "yield". 
# Yield generators only return one element of the iterated object each time through
