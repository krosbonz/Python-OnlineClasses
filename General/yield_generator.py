# Yield

"""The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value 
back to caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where 
it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately 
after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values 
over time, rather them computing them at once and sending them back like a list."""

# A "generator" is any function that contains "yield". 
# Yield generators only return one element of the iterated object each time through

def nextSquare():
    i = 1; 
  
    # An Infinite loop to generate squares  
    while True:
        yield i*i                 
        i += 1  # Next execution resumes from this point      
  
# Driver code to test above generator function 
for num in nextSquare():
    if num > 100:
         break    
    print(num)

# Another example for "yield"

def week(days):
    days = [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday"
    ]
    for day in days:
        yield day

days_week = week()
# And then create a variable for the defined function

# Then call the built in "next()" function, we will see one element in the
# iteration through the days each time through 
>>> next(day_week)
'Monday'
>>> next(day_week)
'Tuesday'
>>> next(day_week)
'Wednesday'

# Infinite Generator

    nums = (1, 2, 3, 4)

Exercise 86 make_song;

# My answer;
def make_song(max=99, bev="soda"):
    count = []
    for x in range(max):
        while max - len(count) >= 2:
            count.append(x)
            beer = abs(max - len(count)) + 1
            yield str(beer)+" bottles of "+str(bev)+" on the wall."
        while max - len(count) == 1:
            count.append(x)
            yield "Only 1 bottle of "+str(bev)+" left!"
        if max - len(count) == 0:
            count.append(x)
            yield "No more "+str(bev)+"!"

# NOTE: Couldn't use "f-string" due to Udemy, so;
# f"{num_beer} bottles of {bev} on the wall"

# The most Pythonic answer;
def make_song(verses=99, beverage="soda"):
    for num in range(verses, -1, -1):
# This range says start at 99, end at -1 and increment backwards by 1 
        if num > 1:
            yield "{} bottles of {} on the wall.".format(num, beverage)
        elif num == 1:
            yield "Only 1 bottle of {} left!".format(beverage)
        else:
            yield "No more {}!".format(beverage)1
